A complete AI analyst system powered by Claude Code. You ask a business question. Claude frames it, explores your data, finds the root cause, builds a story, and hands you a branded slide deck with speaker notes. The whole thing takes minutes, not days.

Ships with the NovaMart demo dataset. Connect your own data with `/connect-data`.

**17** specialized agents | **30** auto-applied skills | **14** slash commands | DAG-based parallel execution | PDF + HTML export

## Don't Know What to Do? Just Ask.

Claude knows the entire system — every agent, skill, command, and dataset. If you're stuck, ask it:

```
What can I do with this data?
What should I run to refresh the deck?
How do I connect my own CSV files?
Which agents handle root cause analysis?
Re-run just the chart maker and deck creator.
```

Claude will tell you the exact command. You don't need to memorize anything in this README. Think of it as a reference — Claude is the guide.

---

## Quick Start

**1. Install Claude Code** (requires a [Claude Pro subscription](https://claude.ai/pro))

```bash
npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code
```

**2. Clone and set up**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ai-analyst-lab/ai-analyst.git
cd ai-analyst
bash scripts/setup.sh
bash scripts/download-data.sh
```

**3. Start Claude Code**

```bash
claude
```

**4. Try it**

```
Why is NovaMart's conversion rate declining?
```

Or go straight to the full pipeline:

```
/run-pipeline data_path=data/novamart/ question="Why is conversion dropping?"
```

For full setup (MotherDuck, MCP connections, troubleshooting): [setup/prerequisites.md](setup/prerequisites.md)

---

## Five Things You Can Do

### 1. Ask a quick question

```
What's our conversion rate by device?
```

Claude queries the data and returns an answer with a chart. Simple questions get answered in under 2 minutes without running the full pipeline.

### 2. Run a full analysis

```
/run-pipeline data_path=data/novamart/ question="What's driving the decline in conversion?"
```

The pipeline runs 17 agents across 4 phases: Frame the question, Analyze the data, Build the story, Create the deck. You get a validated analysis, branded charts, a narrative, and a slide deck with speaker notes. Exports to PDF and HTML.

### 3. Explore a dataset

```
/explore
```

Interactive data browsing without committing to a full analysis. Preview tables, check distributions, spot patterns, form hypotheses. Use `/data users` to inspect a specific table's schema.

### 4. Connect your own data

```
/connect-data
```

Guided wizard that walks you through connecting CSV files, local DuckDB, Postgres, BigQuery, or Snowflake. Auto-profiles your data, creates schema docs, and remembers your dataset context across sessions.

### 5. Make a single chart

```
Make a funnel chart of the checkout flow, highlighting the biggest drop-off step.
```

Claude generates a chart following Storytelling with Data methodology: warm off-white background, decluttered axes, action title, direct labels instead of legends.

## How It Works: The Pipeline

When you run `/run-pipeline`, Claude orchestrates 17 agents across 4 phases:

```
1. FRAME              2. ANALYZE                          3. STORY                 4. DECK
+-----------------+   +-----------------------------+   +--------------------+   +------------------+
| Question        |   | Data Explorer               |   | Story Architect    |   | Storytelling     |
|   Framing       |   |   > Source Tie-Out           |   |   > Coherence      |   |   > Deck Creator |
|   > Hypothesis  |   |   > Descriptive Analytics    |   |     Reviewer       |   |   > Slide Review |
|     Generation  |   |   > Root Cause Investigator  |   |   > Chart Maker    |   |   > Close the    |
|                 |-->|   > Validation               |-->|   > Design Critic  |-->|     Loop         |
+-----------------+   |   > Opportunity Sizer        |   +--------------------+   +------------------+
                      +-----------------------------+
```

**Phase 1 — Frame:** Structures your business question into analytical questions with testable hypotheses. Checkpoint: review the framing before analysis begins.

**Phase 2 — Analyze:** Explores the data, verifies loading integrity, runs segmentation/funnel/drivers analysis, drills down to root cause, validates findings, and sizes the opportunity. Checkpoint: automated quality gate.

**Phase 3 — Story:** Designs a storyboard (Context-Tension-Resolution arc), generates charts with collision detection, and reviews visual quality against a 16-point checklist.

**Phase 4 — Deck:** Writes a stakeholder narrative, builds a branded Marp slide deck with HTML components, reviews slide design, and ensures every recommendation has a follow-up plan. Exports to PDF and HTML.

You don't have to run the whole thing. Five execution plans let you run just the part you need:

| Plan | Use When | What Runs |
|------|----------|-----------|
| `full_presentation` | Complete analysis to slide deck | All 17 agents |
| `deep_dive` | Analysis without presentation | Phases 1-2 only |
| `quick_chart` | Just need one chart | Chart Maker + Design Critic |
| `refresh_deck` | Re-do the presentation layer | Phases 3-4 (reuses analysis) |
| `validate_only` | Check existing work | Validation + Source Tie-Out |

```
/run-pipeline data_path=data/novamart/ question="..." plan=deep_dive
```

If the pipeline gets interrupted, resume where you left off:

```
/resume-pipeline
```

Preview what would run without executing:

```
/run-pipeline data_path=data/novamart/ question="..." dry-run=true
```

---

## How It Works: The DAG Engine

The pipeline doesn't run agents one at a time. It resolves dependencies automatically and runs independent agents in parallel:

```
Tier 0 (parallel)    Question Framing -----> Hypothesis
                     Data Explorer --------> Source Tie-Out
                                                  |
Tier 2 (parallel)              Descriptive Analytics  /  Overtime Trend  /  Cohort Analysis
                                        |
Tier 3 (sequential)           Root Cause --> Validation --> Opportunity Sizer
                                                                |
Tier 4 (sequential)           Story Architect --> Coherence Review
                                                       |
Tier 5 (parallel fan-out)     Chart Maker (per beat) --> Design Critic
                                                              |
Tier 6 (sequential)           Storytelling --> Deck Creator --> Slide Review --> Close the Loop
```

- **Parallel execution:** Agents in the same tier run concurrently (up to 3 at once). Tier 0 starts Question Framing and Data Explorer simultaneously.
- **Automatic dependency resolution:** The engine reads `agents/registry.yaml` and computes execution tiers using topological sort.
- **Circuit breaker:** If 3 agents fail in the same tier, the pipeline halts with a diagnostic report.
- **Timeouts:** Each agent gets 5 minutes. One retry on timeout. Critical agents (source tie-out, validation) halt the pipeline; non-critical agents (design critic) degrade gracefully.
- **Checkpoints:** Quality gates between phases. Two are automated (analysis verification, final deck lint). Two are user-facing (frame review, storyboard review). Say "just do it" to skip the user-facing ones.

## Charts and Visualization

Every chart follows the Storytelling with Data methodology:

```
Your Data --> chart_helpers.py --> Base Chart (150 DPI)
                                      |
                              Collision Check
                              (3 fix strategies)
                                      |
                              Marp Deck (HTML components)
                                      |
                              marp_linter.py (8 check categories)
                                      |
                              marp_export.py --> PDF + HTML
```

**What happens automatically:**

- `swd_style()` applies warm off-white background (#F7F6F2), removes chart clutter (gridlines, borders, redundant legends), sets consistent typography
- Every chart gets an action title (takeaway statement, not a label) and a subtitle (data source, time range)
- Direct labels replace legends wherever possible
- Collision detection checks for overlapping text with 3 auto-fix strategies: offset the label, reduce font size, or drop the least important label. Charts with unresolved collisions halt the pipeline.
- The deck uses branded HTML components: KPI cards, finding cards, recommendation rows, so-what callouts, before/after panels, timelines, and more
- A lint gate validates every deck before export: checks frontmatter completeness, HTML component usage (minimum 3 types), valid slide classes, slide count, and pacing

**Helper modules:**

| Module | What It Does |
|--------|-------------|
| `chart_helpers.py` | Core SWD functions: `swd_style()`, `highlight_bar()`, `highlight_line()`, `action_title()`, `annotate_point()`, `save_chart()`, `stacked_bar()`, `retention_heatmap()`, `funnel_waterfall()`, `check_label_collisions()` |
| `stats_helpers.py` | Statistical tests: proportion tests, mean tests, Mann-Whitney, chi-squared, bootstrap CI, effect size interpretation |
| `analytics_helpers.py` | Analytical utilities for segmentation, decomposition, and driver analysis |
| `forecast_helpers.py` | Time-series forecasting with trend detection and seasonality |
| `marp_linter.py` | Validates Marp decks: frontmatter, HTML components, slide classes, pacing rules |
| `marp_export.py` | Exports decks to PDF and HTML via Marp CLI |

## Your Data

### What ships with the repo

| Dataset | Path | Description |
|---------|------|-------------|
| NovaMart | `data/novamart/` | E-commerce analytics: events, users, products. The built-in demo dataset. |
| Hero | `data/hero/` | Guided exercise dataset |
| Examples | `data/examples/` | Curated public datasets with README guides |

### Connect your own

Run `/connect-data` for a guided setup wizard. Supported sources:

- **CSV files** — drop them in a directory, point Claude at it
- **DuckDB** — local or MotherDuck
- **Postgres** — any Postgres-compatible database
- **BigQuery** — Google BigQuery with service account
- **Snowflake** — Snowflake with user/password or key pair

The system auto-profiles your data, creates schema documentation, notes data quirks, and remembers context across sessions in `.knowledge/datasets/`.

### Fallback chain

If your primary connection fails, the system falls back automatically:

1. Primary connection (e.g., MotherDuck via MCP)
2. Local DuckDB (from `manifest.local_data.duckdb`)
3. CSV files via pandas (from `manifest.local_data.path`)

You're always told which source is active.
